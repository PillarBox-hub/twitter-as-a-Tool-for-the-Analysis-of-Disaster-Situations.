**Interoperability**:
The extraction of information from Twitter is not an easy task because of the nature of data. One the one hand, messages are very heterogeneous containing abbreviations, misspellings, links, emojis, different languages, etc. On the other hand, information may contain rumours and false news, which makes the proper management of information in Twitter difficult. This project uses twitter as a Tool for the Analysis of the Disaster Situation in Ukraine. 

This project also incorporates the use of tweet sentimental analysis on some keywords to look at the effect of disasters in Ukraine.
